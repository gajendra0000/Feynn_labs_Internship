This analysis aims to provide a data-driven approach to market entry, leveraging insights from vehicle industry data, online cab booking statistics, and a detailed segmentation of a major Indian city.

## 3. Data Collection and Preprocessing

### 3.1. Data Sources
Our analysis utilized publicly available data, primarily focusing on:
*   **General Vehicle Type Data:** Information on automobile production and registered vehicles in India (sourced from data.gov.in and IBEF).
*   **Vehicle Industry Data:** Reports on the growth, trends, and investment in the Indian automotive sector (sourced from IBEF).
*   **Online Cab Booking Statistics:** Market forecasts and insights into the taxi and ride-hailing segments in India (sourced from Statista).
*   **Bangalore Cab Booking Data:** A specific dataset (`All-timeTable-Bangalore-Wards.csv`) from Kaggle, providing granular information on cab bookings across different wards in Bangalore.

### 3.2. Data Preprocessing Steps
The raw Bangalore cab booking dataset required significant cleaning and transformation. This involved:
*   Removing non-numeric characters (e.g., '₹', ',') from numerical columns.
*   Converting relevant columns to appropriate numeric data types (float).
*   Converting percentage strings to decimal floats.

## 4. Market Segmentation Analysis

K-Means clustering was used to segment the Bangalore wards based on their cab booking behavior. The Elbow Method was employed to determine the optimal number of clusters.

### 4.1. Optimal Number of Clusters (Elbow Method)
The Elbow Method was used to determine the optimal number of clusters (K). The plot of Sum of Squared Distances (SSD) against the number of clusters indicated an 'elbow' at K=3, suggesting three distinct segments within the Bangalore cab booking market.

### 4.2. Cluster Characteristics and Visualization
Based on the Elbow Method, an optimal K value of 3 was chosen for clustering. The characteristics of each cluster were then analyzed, and a scatter plot was generated to visualize the clusters based on 'Completed Trips' and 'Drivers\' Earnings'.

*   **Cluster 0 (Low Activity, Low Earnings):** This cluster comprises the largest number of wards (152). These wards exhibit the lowest average values across all activity metrics (searches, bookings, completed trips) and drivers' earnings. This segment likely represents areas with lower demand for cab services or areas where traditional transportation methods are more prevalent.

*   **Cluster 1 (Very High Activity, Very High Earnings):** This cluster contains only one ward, which is likely an aggregation of highly active areas (e.g., 'Other Wards' as seen in the raw data). This segment shows exceptionally high values for all activity metrics and drivers' earnings, indicating a highly saturated and competitive market with significant existing demand.

*   **Cluster 2 (Moderate Activity, Moderate Earnings):** This cluster consists of 92 wards. These wards demonstrate moderate levels of searches, bookings, completed trips, and drivers' earnings. This segment represents areas with a healthy and consistent demand for cab services, without the extreme saturation observed in Cluster 1.
