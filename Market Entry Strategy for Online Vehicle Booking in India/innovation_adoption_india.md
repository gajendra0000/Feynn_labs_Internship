## Innovation Adoption Life Cycle and Market Entry in India

### Overview of Innovation Adoption Life Cycle
The Innovation Adoption Life Cycle, as described by Everett Rogers, categorizes adopters of new technologies into five groups:
1.  **Innovators (2.5%):** Venturesome, eager to try new ideas, risk-takers, often have financial resources.
2.  **Early Adopters (13.5%):** Opinion leaders, integrated into the social system, respected, eager to try new ideas but more judicious than innovators.
3.  **Early Majority (34%):** Deliberate, adopt new ideas just before the average person, interact frequently with peers.
4.  **Late Majority (34%):** Skeptical, adopt new ideas just after the average person, often due to economic necessity or social pressure.
5.  **Laggards (16%):** Traditional, last to adopt an innovation, often isolated, suspicious of innovations.

For a new product or service, targeting Innovators and Early Adopters is crucial for early market success and gaining momentum.

### Geographical Application in India
*   The diffusion of innovations can be spatially distributed. Early adopters and later majorities show different spatial patterns of adoption.
*   Cities with high digital adoption, a significant young and tech-savvy population, and a thriving startup ecosystem are likely to have a higher concentration of innovators and early adopters.
*   Tier-1 cities (e.g., Bangalore, Mumbai, Delhi-NCR) are typically early adopters of new technologies and services due to higher disposable income, better infrastructure, and a more globally connected population.
