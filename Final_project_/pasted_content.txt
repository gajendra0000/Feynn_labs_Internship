Task Overview:

Simulate a complete Credit Risk Modeling project using a realistically generated synthetic dataset of 2000 samples that mimics consumer credit behavior (like credit card or personal loan users).

The deliverables must include:

✅ Python notebook with complete end-to-end modeling pipeline

✅ Final CSV dataset (credit_risk_synthetic.csv)

✅ Detailed PDF/Markdown report with analysis and beautiful visualizations

✅ Business-style scorecard summary

✅ Visual dashboards or static charts for all EDA and monitoring steps

📌 Part 1: Data Generation
Generate a synthetic dataset of 2000 records with realistic distributions (not purely random).

Ensure variables are inspired by actual LendingClub or credit card datasets.

Variable categories should include:

🔹 Demographics / Application Variables:

age, annual_income, emp_length, home_ownership, loan_amount, purpose, loan_term, verification_status

🔹 Behavioral / Credit History:

revol_util, revol_bal, earliest_credit_line (date), credit_inquiries_last_6m, open_credit_lines, credit_utilization, delinquency_2yrs, total_current_balance

🔹 Target Variables:

loan_status (simulate fully_paid, charged_off, default)

recovered_amount

total_rec_prncp

funded_amnt

📌 Part 2: Preprocessing & Feature Engineering
Apply the following transformations in the notebook:

✅ Missing Value Treatment
Median for numeric, mode or “Unknown” for categoricals

✅ Derived Features:
installment_to_income = installment / annual_income

months_since_earliest_credit = issue_date - earliest_credit_line

credit_utilization = revol_bal / credit_limit

✅ Feature Binning
Use fine classing via quantiles (pd.qcut) on continuous variables

Use coarse classing by merging bins with similar default rates

✅ WOE & IV:
Calculate WOE and IV for each predictor variable (after binning)

Drop variables with IV < 0.02

Apply WOE transformation to final features

📌 Part 3: Target Variables
🎯 PD:
Binary target:

\text{default_flag} = 1 \text{ if loan_status = 'Charged Off' or 'Default'};\quad 0 \text{ otherwise}
🎯 LGD:
\text{LGD} = \frac{\text{funded_amnt} - \text{recovered_amount}}{\text{funded_amnt}}
🎯 EAD:
\text{EAD} = \text{funded_amnt} - \text{total_rec_prncp}
📌 Part 4: Model Building
✅ PD Model:
Use logistic regression

Evaluate using AUC, KS-statistic

Generate a scorecard from logistic model coefficients

Output: Probability of Default + score

✅ LGD & EAD Models:
Use beta regression or any regression algorithm that handles fractional outputs (0–1)

Evaluate using RMSE, R²

📌 Part 5: Model Monitoring
Create tracking charts for:

KS Statistic

PSI (Population Stability Index) — simulate time drift over 2 months

Include data drift and feature drift visualizations

📌 Part 6: Report & Visualizations
Create a structured report with:

📊 Descriptive stats & univariate analysis

🔍 Bivariate analysis vs. target

📈 Correlation heatmap

📉 Default rate plots by variable (bin-wise)

🎯 ROC Curve, AUC, KS for PD

📊 PSI bar chart

📋 Scorecard summary (score buckets, % defaults)

🔚 Output Structure:
credit_risk_synthetic.csv – full dataset after cleaning

credit_risk_modeling.ipynb – Jupyter notebook with all code

credit_risk_report.pdf or Markdown file – detailed technical + business analysis

PNG/Plotly charts embedded for visual clarity

(Optional) Export scorecard in Excel-style table
